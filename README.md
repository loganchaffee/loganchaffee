# Hey there everyone ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
-  I am a full-stack web developer who loves to create web apps that fill a diverse set of needs. I'm skilled in designing, developing, and testing web applications using a range of different technologies. I have made all kinds of responsive websites and web apps that are intuitive and easy to use.

-  I love using the MERN stack, and I focus a lot on front-end development with React. I love using it to build responsive user interfaces and single page apps with React Router. I'm also picking up new tools and technologies all the time, always learning and developing my skills.

- :wrench: What I'm Working On: Currently working on a reading motivation/tracking app that I'm building with the MERN stack.  
- :seedling: What I'm Learning: Learning more about MongoDB and Express.  
- :smiley: Fun Facts About Me: :space_invader: I love alien movies, :metal: heavy metal, and ðŸ›¹ skateboarding.  

## Recent Projects I've Worked On:

Portfolio site for my wife Lauren Chaffee: https://lauren-chaffee-styles.herokuapp.com/
- This is a site that I made for my wife for her hair stylist business. This site shows the services she offers, allows clients to book appointments, and has a portfolio section that fetches images from my wifes instagram acount and displays them in a gallery. I used React and React Router for the front end and set up the backend with node.js to handle the form submissions and the email confirmations.

808 Drum Machine: https://logandrummachine.netlify.app/
- This is a simple little app I made when I was learning how state works in react. I wanted to make something that could take simple input from a user (like buttons on a drum pad) and change the state of the screen on the machine and play that corrisponding sound. It was a fun project that I made in a couple hours, and it taught me a lot about react.

Rainy Days Game: http://loganraingame.surge.sh/ 
-  This little game I made was inspired by space invaders and my home city of Portland Oregon, where the constant rain always seems to bum me outÂ ðŸ˜†Â I started this project to familiarize myself with javascript by challenging myself to do something I've never done. It allowed me to work with HTML Canvas and an animation loop. I also got to work with object oriented javascript to construct the player and the enemies.

Photography site for Ryan Fowler: https://www.loganchaffee.com/projects/fowler-portfolio-site/index.html
- For this project I made a site for Ryan Fowler, a photographer who likes to focus on candid photography and portraits. I tried to keep the design simple and clean to focus on the his photographs more than anything.
