## Recent Projects I've Worked On:
Rainy Days Game: http://loganraingame.surge.sh/ 
-  This little game I made was inspired by space invaders and my home city of Portland Oregon, where the constant rain always seems to bum me out :laughing: I started this project to familiarize myself with javascript by challenging myself to do somthing I've never done. It alowed me to work with HTML Canvas and an animation loop. I also got to work with object oriented javascript to construct the player and the enemies.

Photography site for Ryan Fowler: https://www.loganchaffee.com/projects/fowler-portfolio-site/index.html
- For this I made a site for Ryan Fowler a photographer who likes to focus on candid photography and portraits. I tried to keep the design simple and clean to focus on the his photographs more than anything. This was also a fun project because I used javascript to build a pop up model that could cycle through the photos in his gallery.

Currency Exchange App http://logancurrencyapp.surge.sh/
- This is an app I made that can convert the value of any currency to another. This app was made using two different API's. The Exhange Rate API handles the calculations for the exchange rates between countries, and the Rest Countries API handles the rest of the country data like currency names and country lists. This allowed my application to update all of data as the values of currencies fluctuate.
