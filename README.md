# Hey there everyone ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a full-stack web developer who loves to create web apps that meet all kinds of needs. I'm skilled in designing, developing, and testing web applications using a range of different technologies. I have made all kinds of responsive websites and web apps that are intuitive and easy to use.

When it comes to development, I enjoy working across the full stack. For front end development, I focus a lot on React for building interactive user interfaces. React is my favorite framework to work with for building client-side applications. For server-side development, I use NodeJS along side ExpressJS. I really enjoy using these to build APIs that my client-side apps can use. For databases I like to use both SQL and MongoDB. They both have their strengths, and I try to take advantage of them where I can.

Currently, I am working full time with an E-commerce company here in Portland Oregon. But I am always taking on side projects and freelance work as well. If you would like to work with me, please feel free to contact me below.
